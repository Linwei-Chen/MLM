# Multi-Level Map (MLM) Dataset

A large-scale high-quality dataset for map generation at multiple zoom levels.

To develop and evaluate learning-based multi-level map generation methods, the dataset consisting of paired samples of aerial images and maps with multiple zoom levels is important. Thus, we collect and produce a large-scale high-quality Multi-Level Map (MLM) dataset for map generation at multiple zoom levels. The data comes from Google Maps and Tianditu. 

The code is available at [here](https://github.com/FZfangzheng/SI-LACMMT)

The MLM dataset is now publicly available!
